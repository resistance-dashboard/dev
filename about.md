How much should we worry about Trump and Republican majority government? Will Trump be unpredictable leader with unpredictable moderate tendencies and some policies that serve the nation well? Or do we face creeping totalitarianism coupled with persecution of minorities and hard right ideological governance? Will things be great or shitty? We track estimates of his performance on several dimensions on the resistance dashboard. These point estimates (with associated confidence intervals) are highly multivariate in origin, based on neural network and advanced natural language processing on an substantial data store; current values are shown on the dials and graphed since after election day 11/8/2016. We will also be producing estimates of change in certain policy areas, like health care, climate change, taxation, and the like.

Be aware that we make no representation that our estimates provide any more value than your own personal estimates. Trump seems to be unpredictable by nature and by design and it sometimes appears that it is anyoneâ€™s guess where he will end up. All we can do, like everyone else, is try to read the tea leaves as best we can. Please let us know where you differ from us in your own estimates; for example, if you think we are estimating him too low or high on the racism scale let us know. We may be incorporating your opinions into our estimates at some point. Also, we may change our methodology, recalculate, and end up with different values for both current and past data.

Some changes proposed or implemented by the Trump gang may require resistance. We will suggest strategic and tactical actions to help, including supporting efforts, organizations or politicians local or national. We will be looking for and compiling your input on resistance options.
